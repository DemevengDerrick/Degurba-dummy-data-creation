## Load Libraries

```{r}

if(!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,
  ggplot2,
  sf,
  haven,
  gt,
  tmap,
  RColorBrewer
)
```

## Load Data

GPS locations of buildings hosting households

```{r}

gps_points <- sf::st_read("input/jrc_data/new_points/point_dummy_mw_popcount.shp")

```

Boundaries of dummy data

```{r}
boundaries_dummy <- sf::st_read("input/jrc_data/poly_dummy_mw_pop.shp")
```

Zambia Microcensus Data 2010

```{r}

micro_census_data <- haven::read_sav("output/cleaned_dummy_data.sav")
```

## Data Exploration

Number of households

```{r}
households <- micro_census_data |>
  dplyr::group_by(HH_ID, CONSTITUENCY) |>
  count(name = "Number of People") |>
  tibble::tibble()
```

Visualize GPS location

```{r}

tmap::tm_shape(shp = boundaries_dummy) +
  tmap::tm_borders() +
tmap::tm_shape(shp = gps_points) +
  tmap::tm_symbols(
    col = "blue", fill = "blue"
  )
```

## Data Transformation

### Create Artificial Constituencies in the GPS by cluster analysis

Because the GPS data is randomly generated, we want to create artificial clusters that are going to represent our constitencies so as we have a logical assignment of households within buildings. if we do not do this, we will have two houselhold from different constituencies in one building Which violates spatial laws.

```{r}
# transform the gps coordinates into a matrix
coords_matrix <- st_coordinates(gps_points)

# Create clusters to represent constituencies
set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(coords_matrix, centers = 190)

# Add cluster ID to buildings
gps_points$constituency_id <- kmeans_result$cluster


```

```{r}
gps_points$constituency_id <- gps_points$constituency_id - 1
```

```{r}
# map the clusters
# Create a palette with 150 colors
big_palette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(12, "Set3"))(150)

tm_shape(gps_points) +
  tm_symbols(
    col = "constituency_id",
    palette = big_palette,
    size = 0.5,
    title.col = "Cluster ID"
  ) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# Map constituencies clusters
ggplot2::ggplot(data = gps_points) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(aes(color = constituency_id), size = .5) +
  ggplot2::theme_void()
```

## Assign households to each buildings

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Simulated data
# gps_points <- data.frame(id = ..., constituency_id = ...)
# households <- data.frame(household_id = ..., CONST_P = ...)

# Step 1: Count households and buildings per constituency
hh_counts <- households |>
  count(CONSTITUENCY, name = "n_households")

building_counts <- gps_points |>
  count(constituency_id, name = "n_buildings")

# Step 2: Merge into assign_table
assign_table <- hh_counts |>
  inner_join(building_counts, by = c("CONSTITUENCY" = "constituency_id")) |>
  mutate(remaining_hh = n_households - n_buildings)

# Step 3: Assign 1 household per building
assigned_minimum <- assign_table |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(
    base_assignment = list(rep(
      gps_points |> filter(constituency_id == CONSTITUENCY) |> pull(id),
      length.out = n_buildings
    ))
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  unnest(cols = c(base_assignment))

# Step 4: Assign remaining households randomly
assigned_remaining <- assign_table |>
  filter(remaining_hh > 0) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(
    extra_assignments = list(
      sample(
        gps_points |> filter(constituency_id == CONSTITUENCY) |> pull(id),
        size = remaining_hh,
        replace = TRUE
      )
    )
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  unnest(cols = c(extra_assignments)) |>
  rename(base_assignment = extra_assignments)

# Step 5: Combine both sets of assignments
all_assigned_buildings <- bind_rows(assigned_minimum, assigned_remaining) |>
  group_by(CONSTITUENCY) |>
  mutate(row_id = row_number())

# Step 6: Match to households
households_final <- households |>
  group_by(CONSTITUENCY) |>
  mutate(row_id = row_number()) |>
  left_join(all_assigned_buildings, by = c("CONSTITUENCY", "row_id")) |>
  select(-row_id)

# Rename the building assignment column
names(households_final)[names(households_final) == "base_assignment"] <- "assigned_building_id"

# Optional: Add geometry by joining to gps_points
households_with_coords <- households_final |>
  left_join(gps_points, by = c("assigned_building_id" = "id"))
```

## Assign building IDs to the dummy micro-census data

```{r}

dummy_microcensus <- 
  micro_census_data |>
  dplyr::left_join(households_with_coords |> 
                     dplyr::select(HH_ID, assigned_building_id),
                   by = c("HH_ID")
                  )
```

```{r}

dummy_microcensus <- dummy_microcensus |>
  dplyr::select(1:5, "BUILDING_ID" = assigned_building_id, 7:ncol(dummy_microcensus)-1) |>
  dplyr::rename("CONSTITUENCY" = CONSTITUENCY.x)

dummy_microcensus <- dummy_microcensus |>
  dplyr::select(1:ncol(dummy_microcensus)-1)
```

## Compute the Number of People per Building

```{r}

people_per_building <- dummy_microcensus |>
  dplyr::group_by(BUILDING_ID) |>
  count(name = "Building_pop")
```

## Assign People per Building to GPS Points

```{r}

gps_points <- gps_points |>
  dplyr::left_join(people_per_building,
                   by = c("id" = "BUILDING_ID")
                   )
```

## Export new point data

```{r}

sf::st_write(gps_points, "output/point_dummy_mw_popcount_new.shp", delete_layer = T)
```

## Compute the Number of People per Constituency

```{r}

people_per_constutuency <- dummy_microcensus |>
  dplyr::group_by(CONSTITUENCY) |>
  count(name = "Constitency_pop")
```

## Assign People per Constituency to Constituency shapes

```{r}

boundaries_dummy <- boundaries_dummy |>
  dplyr::left_join(people_per_constutuency,
                   by = c("id" = "CONSTITUENCY")
                   )
```

```{r}
sf::st_write(boundaries_dummy, "output/poly_dummy_mw_pop_new.shp", delete_layer = T)
```

## Export micro-census data into sav & csv files

```{r}

haven::write_sav(dummy_microcensus, path = "output/dummy_microcensus_final.sav")
```

```{r}

write.csv(micro_census_data, file = "output/dummy_microcensus_final.csv")
```
